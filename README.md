Hi! I am Siddhant Rajoriya, a millennial coder passionate about dramas, anime, anime dramas, and connecting with new people!

About me: 
I am a sophomore pursuing Computer Science at the Pennsylvania State University. I come from Bhopal, India, a city of lakes, pleasant weather, trees and parks! Growing up in a peaceful city, I have turned out to be a peace-loving person. I am a champion of decency, politeness, and chivalry; though there are moments when I leave it all up to a higher power, and start watching anime/dramas. My all-time favorites are Haikyu, One Punch Man, and Reply 1988. I also love concerts, deep one-on-one conversations, and slow indie music. My motto is: Keep trying new things, until you know you don't like them! 

Technical Aspects:
I have experience working in Python, JAVA, SQL and C, and have used tools like Git, Android Studio, NetBeans and VSCode. This summer, I worked on 'Dormify', an android SDK based application that helps individuals find compatible roommates on a college campus. Some of my other projects include a Twitter Clone (using Twitter REST API), a movie browsing app (using the Movie Database API) and a To-do application with items management functionality. 
Currently, I am enrolled in a Data Structures and Algorithms course (which is no joke), a systems programming course introducing C, and a digital electronics introduction course. I am also on my way to learn HTML and CSS. 
On a career point of view, I am interested in Full-stack development, Systems development, and Artificial Intelligence. As of Fall 2021, I am looking to work on an industry-based real-time software development project in the coming spring or summer 2022. If you have any pointers, directions or connections looking for someone like me, please let me know!
